        <p>To create my data pipeline, I followed these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Load CSV Data:</strong> Open and read the CSV file located at <a href="/data/refined_data.csv">data/refined_data.csv</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Extract Headers:</strong> Retrieve the first row from the CSV to use as keys for creating dictionaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Transform Data:</strong> For each subsequent row, map the data to the headers, forming a dictionary for each row.</li>
            <li><strong>Save to JSON:</strong> Compile all the dictionaries into a list and write this list to a new file, <a href="/data/refined_data.json">data/refined_data.json</a>, in a structured JSON format.</li>
            <li><strong>Close Files:</strong> Ensure all file operations are properly closed after reading and writing data.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In my project, I focused on turning complex data into clear, simple visuals that anyone can understand quickly. I used a geo chart because it shows state-by-state data in a way that's familiar to Americans. I also chose a pie chart to display percentages because it matches well with how people visualize proportions. However, I'm thinking about changing from a circular to a rectangular pie chart to make the differences between states stand out more, even with few data points. In terms of feedback, I was told to add graph titles, provide averages for people to compare against in the micro pages, and create a standard color palette. In addition, Mr. Gohde suggested that in my micro page, I switch from a circular pie chart to a rectangular/bar pie chart.</p>
