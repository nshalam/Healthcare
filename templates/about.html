    <p>Source: KFF <a href="https://www.kff.org/2fdbf6d/">https://www.kff.org/2fdbf6d/</a></p>
    <p>To create my data pipeline, I created <a href="/data/reformatData.py">this python code</a> to properly separate the data by state and reformat it into <a href="/data/refined_data.json">this json file</a>.</p>

I used a geo chart because it shows state-by-state data in a way that's familiar to Americans. I also chose a pie chart to display percentages because it matches well with how people visualize proportions. However, I'm thinking about changing from a circular to a rectangular pie chart to make the differences between states stand out more, even with few data points.</p>
